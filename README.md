❄️ Repo for my solutions to Advent of Code 2020

- **Day 1**: Interesting first day! Site went down, so was unable to retrieve my input. Site was back up in about 3 minutes, and I had already written my code, so it was just a matter of copy pasting. Got place 370 on first part and 167 on part two, globally.

- **Day 2**: Today's problems were a little bit tougher than yesterdays, but not terribly bad. I unfortunately turned in a couple of wrong answers which meant I had to wait to be able to submit my correct answer. Took me 14 minutes to get both stars.

- **Day 3**: A good day today! Kinda interesting and made a quite simple algorithm.

- **Day 4**: Today's problem was a bit tricky. Involved a bit of nasty if statements from my part. But got there in the end!

- **Day 5**: Day 5 was a fun problem! Involved some math and logic and that's always nice!

- **Day 6**: This day's problem was relatively easy, however it took me a minute before understanding what to do on part 2.
