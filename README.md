❄️ Repo for my solutions to Advent of Code 2020

- **Day 1**: Interesting first day! Site went down, so was unable to retrieve my input. Site was back up in about 3 minutes, and I had already written my code, so it was just a matter of copy pasting. Got place 370 on first part and 167 on part two, globally.
