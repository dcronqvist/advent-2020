❄️ Repo for my solutions to Advent of Code 2020

- **Day 1**: Interesting first day! Site went down, so was unable to retrieve my input. Site was back up in about 3 minutes, and I had already written my code, so it was just a matter of copy pasting. Got place 370 on first part and 167 on part two, globally.

- **Day 2**: Today's problems were a little bit tougher than yesterdays, but not terribly bad. I unfortunately turned in a couple of wrong answers which meant I had to wait to be able to submit my correct answer. Took me 14 minutes to get both stars.
