❄️ Repo for my solutions to Advent of Code 2020

- **Day 1**: Interesting first day! Site went down, so was unable to retrieve my input. Site was back up in about 3 minutes, and I had already written my code, so it was just a matter of copy pasting. Got place 370 on first part and 167 on part two, globally.

- **Day 2**: Today's problems were a little bit tougher than yesterdays, but not terribly bad. I unfortunately turned in a couple of wrong answers which meant I had to wait to be able to submit my correct answer. Took me 14 minutes to get both stars.

- **Day 3**: A good day today! Kinda interesting and made a quite simple algorithm.

- **Day 4**: Today's problem was a bit tricky. Involved a bit of nasty if statements from my part. But got there in the end!

- **Day 5**: Day 5 was a fun problem! Involved some math and logic and that's always nice!

- **Day 6**: This day's problem was relatively easy, however it took me a minute before understanding what to do on part 2.

- **Day 7**: Interesting problem today, a bit of recursion and using dicts goes a long way!

- **Day 8**: I really liked today's problem. It's fun trying to parse and run a made up programming language!

- **Day 9**: My solution for today was a rather brute force method which worked surprisingly well, even if it's time complexity wasn't that good.

- **Day 10**: Today's problem was a bit more difficult for me. I haven't worked that much with combinatorics, so it was good practice :)

- **Day 11**: This problem was quite interesting! It took me a bit of extra time to get right since I had read the instructions too fast and missed out a case :(

- **Day 12**: Interesting stuff, thought about using complex numbers to decide angle but it would be nowhere near as fast as just using basic linear algebra vector rotation.

- **Day 13**: A lot of math was involved in this one, ended up using the chinese remainder theorem to solve part 2.

- **Day 14**: Today was fun! I haven't had much time to do these problems in the morning unfortunately, so I've fallen down the leaderboard :(

- **Day 15**: I went up in time today! I had some trouble getting the hang of the rules for the game the elves were playing, but once it clicked I managed to solve it relatively quickly.
